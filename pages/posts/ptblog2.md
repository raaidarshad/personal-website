UPDATE: Started work on another idea to validate that was on hold, so I will not be working on this _every_ day this week. Primary focus is still refactoring the ETL side of things given what I learned upon the first pass of deploying it, so the current priorities from last week are still the current priorities this week.

## OKRs
Current period ends December 31, 2021.
