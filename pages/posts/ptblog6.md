## Standup logs


### Monday

**What did you do yesterday?** Got keyword extraction to work, which involved setting up more Alembic things and updating the models. Could prove useful as an index over time, too!

**What will you do today?** Experiment with figuring out what sentences are saying the same thing. Seems DAUNTING, but want to just start thinking and designing around it. I am certainly procrastinating on the UI side of things with this.

**What, if anything, is blocking your progress?** Front end/design help.

### Tuesday

**What did you do yesterday?** Got a proof-of-concept implemented for comparing two sentences in an effort to see if they "say the same thing"!

**What will you do today?** Take a step back/up and accept that even if my product/service is not "ready", it never really will be as I'll always want to make it better, and I need to just get it in front of people. I've been resisting that but I need to get over it, so I will. Going to write and share a "this is what I'm doing" post and share it far and wide, create my ideal "view" of my product in Figma, communicate needs/desires to a friend who has agreed to help with design, and write down my top 3-5 questions for experienced non-profit folk. LET'S GO.

**What, if anything, is blocking your progress?** Dramatic music: FEAR!

### Wednesday

**What did you do yesterday?** Wrote a first draft of my "this is what I'm doing" post, gave my designer friend what they need to work their magic, researched and came up with my 5-6 main nonprofit questions, and brainstormed some "ideal view" ideas. Reached out to one of the nonprofit people my network put me in contact with too!

**What will you do today?** Mostly work on the other project, work a wee bit more on what the article cluster view and such should look like.

**What, if anything, is blocking your progress?** Still fear?

Cheers,
