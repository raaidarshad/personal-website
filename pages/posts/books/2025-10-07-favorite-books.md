# Favorite Books

This will likely change a lot over time, but at any given moment, this is my list of favorite books (that I'd also generally recommend).

### Fiction

*   Flowers for Algernon, by Daniel Keyes: I absolutely love this book. It's such a fascinating exploration of what it means to be human, of intellect, of compassion, of what's important. I've also rarely read anything that's written in this style. The book is written like journal entries from the point of view of a character who goes through major change. The changes are expressed not just in the content, but in the very manner of writing. It's truly extraordinary.
    
*   The Daevabad Trilogy, by S.A. Chakraborty: I can't say enough positive things about this trilogy. It's well written, it's well paced. The character development is deep, I was actually made to care about and feel a personality for major characters quite quickly. The setting is (sadly) novel, in that it is based on mythology of the Arab and Islamic worlds. It both respects and honors the setting while tactfully challenging aspects of it. The imagery is amazing. The world building is so beautifully descriptive, I can actually picture the world in my head with ease. I want more content of this world. If you like fantasy, you should read this. If you like good writing, you should read this. If you like interesting characters, you should read this.
    
*   The Silo Series, by Hugh Howey: What a creative dystopia! This is another more recent trilogy that I really enjoyed. I suppose it can be called sci-fi, though it sits in a much more terrestrial setting than many sci-fi books. WIP
