# Raaid Reads - Lost Connections

### What is it?
[Lost Connections](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections) by Johann Hari is oversold and smacks of "I'm writing about something I don't have expertise in". He makes bold claims about why you are depressed and why SSRIs don't work (he's wrong if scientific consensus is your barometer, and the [NHS page on it](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/medicines-and-psychiatry/antidepressants/overview/) provides a wonderful overview of what we know). Don't get me wrong, he's clearly a talented writer and brings forth stories that many of us can relate to. Intuitively, a lot of the external causes of depression he highlights _feel_ right, and often are a part of the cause. But to portray it as "society is bad, drugs don't work, it's a mystery that I have solved" is pretty reckless.

### Why don't I like it?
A few years ago, Bloomberg came out with a story called [The Big Hack](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies). It got lots of traction. People in my (software) tech-y circles were reading it and amazed, and believed it. Me? Not so much. I (please don't read this as bragging of any kind, it's really just context that is necessary) have a degree in Electrical Engineering and worked at a robotics company for a year designing and prototyping circuit boards. I have used lots of different integrated circuits (ICs) in my designs, and have a general understanding of what is feasible. I was immediately skeptical of what the authors were outlining. But it was no use. My peers found it convincing, and _of course_ Apple and the U.S. government were going to say that it isn't true.

I admire and respect journalists at large, I think they have a very difficult job. Hold truth to power, tell me when the politician is lying. But this? I know about this. Your understanding of this fairly complicated space is lacking. I imagine this is how most any medical professional feels when reading Lost Connections.

Hari tells beautiful stories. He highlights things like "disconnection from nature" and "disconnection from people" as _true_ causes of depression. He cites research to back it up. The problem is, he exhibits rigor in the face of medication, but lacks this rigor entirely when discussing "disconnection". He makes you feel, he humanizes, he hooks into your intuition, but misdirects you. Do I feel lower when I go all day in my apartment, with no interaction, without seeing a tree, without moving my body? Do I feel lower if my economic situation is precarious? Obviously, I do. To say that this is all novel, that it's a conspiracy to keep you hooked to pills, is ludicrous.

A lot of the research he cites about these "disconnections" isn't new, and is in part accepted by the medical community. One of the things my therapist asked me in my first session was about my support network of people, about exercise, diet, sleep, about spending time outside, and other pieces of my life. Maybe I'm lucky and got an exceptional therapist. I will agree that my doctor who then prescribed some antidepressants didn't really ask much about my life context, but to his credit it's because he knew I had a therapist and agreed to try antidepressants at a particularly low point.

Anyway, there is plenty of skewering of this book online already, as I learned after I finished reading it. He was also fired from the Independent for various wrongdoings. As one last writing-based note, to call all of the environmental factors he lists "connections" is weak wordplay to tie together very disparate things that make up life. It feels forced, unnecessary, and incomplete.

### Why should you read it?
You probably don't need to bother at all. If you're interested in the stories he highlights of people finding meaning, of coming together, then go for it. Just remember to keep a skeptical eye over all the evidence provided, since much of it (even from the Harvard guy) is questionable or ill-sourced. Instead, I suggest [The Mindful Way through Depression](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/112588.The_Mindful_Way_through_Depression) which is written by 4 experts. Please don't take my word for it and look it up yourself if you'd like, but from what I have read mindfulness and meditation actually seem to have pretty good clinical results in helping some people with their depression (just like drugs). It sure helps me, at least.
