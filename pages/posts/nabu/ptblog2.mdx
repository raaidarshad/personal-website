UPDATE: The purpose of the Key Requirements was to measure interest for idea validation. Given that the idea is already validated to an extent by another organization (see Friday's stand-up notes), _proving_ this seems less important, but this will still be important once I have a product to show.

Also, I found a [research report from the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2016/07/07/the-modern-news-consumer/) I bookmarked a while back that has a lot of data to suggest there is a young, online-news-reading demographic that knows there is bias in their news and would really appreciate tools/products/services that address that.
