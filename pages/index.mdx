# Raaid Arshad

I like making things, especially things that help people and counteract socioeconomic/political injustice. So far I've been a software engineer, an electrical engineer, and a musician.


Things I am currently working on:
- [DbDeclare](https://github.com/raaidarshad/dbdeclare): A Python library to easily define your Postgres cluster (dbs, roles, privileges, etc.). I find there is a gap between tools like SQLAlchemy (which does a stellar job of defining tables) and infrastructure as code (which define the database cluster, version, instance size, etc.). So hopefully this is useful to fill in that gap, at least for Python and Postgres users!


Things I've made outside of "work" (and are on the backburner or spun down):
- [Nabu](https://nabu.news): A landing page for tools/services to identify and understand bias. The first tool is a [news feed](https://www.nabu.news/latest) that shows articles from across newsrooms grouped by topic. The second tool is a [browser extension](https://www.nabu.news) that shows similar articles to the one you are currently viewing. This has been turned off (for now) due to monthly costs, was actually getting some users though!
- Cado: A gifting service centered on local businesses. Built a prototype with two cofounders, piloted it for ~3 months, spun it down.
